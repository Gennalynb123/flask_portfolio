# PBL 3-4 Week 3
## Links to issues for this week
### - [Individual Research](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/issues/13)
### - [Individual Coding. Includes home pages](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/issues/12)
### - [Shows location for Mini-labs/Concepts, Brain Write, Wireframes, Greet, and TPT3](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/issues/11)
### - [Shows the prototype of our layout, with our own style](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/issues/10)
#### We still want to have our layout more personalized, along with our individual home pages, but we are satisfied with our progress for this week. A lot of our time was spent on learning how to get images into our projects and create backgrounds. Overall, we created a Mini-Labs/concepts dropdown that includes Brain Write, Wireframes, Greet, TPT3, and our individual home pages. We will likely move our home pages to a different section once they are developed more. We successfully came up with a theme and integrated it into our about page.

## Project Ideation
### Our Idea: A website that gives the user a personality test and recommends music based on their given personality type
#### Our Audience can learn about their personality type based on their answers on the test.
#### Our website will have information on those who worked on it as well as information about it's production

### Frontside Ideas
#### Our homepage will be a directory that helps guide our audience to different personality tests.
#### Tests will ask the audience a series of questions, and will determine traits specific to the audience based on the answers chosen.
#### Our Webpage will have a top facing navigation bar with links to a homepage

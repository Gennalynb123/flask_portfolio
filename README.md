## Project Ideation
### Our Idea: A website that gives the user a personality test
#### Our Audience can learn about their personality type based on their answers on the test.
#### Our website will have information on those who worked on it as well as information about it's production
### Frontside Ideas
#### Our homepage will be a directory that helps guide our audience to different personality tests.
#### Tests will ask the audience a series of questions, and will determine traits specific to the audience based on the answers chosen.
#### Our Webpage will have a top facing navigation bar with links to a homepage, About > dropdown with team members, Celestial Objects > dropdown with different objects, Mini-Labs > dropdown with different pages including a greetings page, Journals

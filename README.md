# PBL 3-4 Week 3
## Links to issues for this week
### - [Individual Research](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/issues/13)
### - [Individual Coding. Includes home pages](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/issues/12)
### - [Shows location for Mini-labs/Concepts, Brain Write, Wireframes, Greet, and TPT3](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/issues/11)
### - [Shows the prototype of our layout, with our own style](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/issues/10)
#### We still want to have our layout more personalized, along with our individual home pages, but we are satisfied with our progress for this week. A lot of our time was spent on learning how to get images into our projects and create backgrounds. Overall, we created a Mini-Labs/concepts dropdown that includes Brain Write, Wireframes, Greet, TPT3, and our individual home pages. We will likely move our home pages to a different section once they are developed more. We successfully came up with a theme and integrated it into our about page.

# PBL 1-2 Table of Contents
## Peer Review Grading
### PBL(Team):
#### - Score: 4/4
#### - [Scrum Board](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/projects/1): The scrum master has defined all tasks on the scrum board, designer has been working on a wire frame, and the technical lead has  coordinated two brainwrites where we discussed website ideas.
#### - GitHub Assets: Navigators have started testing any new additions, developers have started work on dropdown menu, and other developers have integrated [Journal0](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/Journals.html) to a separate page, and finally developers have integrated greet into individual minilab pages: [Sahil](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/Sahil.html), [Erik](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/Erik.html), [Yash](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/Yash.html), [Isaac](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/Isaac.html)
#### - [TPT Points](https://padlet.com/amv7668/5dauht31raq9w168) (see Group #8 on the Padlet): The group has created a visual proof-of-concept in the padlet during the TPT and explained the basic idea of the project. We later decided to change our idea and did another brainwrite [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1blPXDeaPubER-gAHyGBngrtxeN-vLiY5WKN-2aqO8-Q/edit).

### PBL(Individual):
Each name has a link to their mini-lab page for greet integration.
- [Sahil](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/Sahil.html) 4/4 points individual - I have mainly been working on the mini-lab items, assigning issues, and helping my team with specific tasks. I have made important additions and fixes to the Journal page and dropdown page, and my commits for each respectively are [here](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/commit/55f7ab62bd6fa7e2cdab29feb407838dd06abb80) and [here](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/commit/1dbb6497b39e8ef272502aef5fa81c4924bee206). I have also made significant contributions to our brainwrite idea for the website. I successfully integrated greet into my individual minilab page and helped to troubleshoot our navbar, eventually fixing our issue by deleting the starter tabs in [this](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/commit/8af32a7055e153b8a21c29ae2644b08dd247e99f) commit. Here are my [video notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/178ia2aVmz9SylZjKJ1U_9Ar68pC0fhWnWqQP9Yjk910/edit) for the collegeboard videos. My personal work/computer plan is to always bring and use my own laptop with all the proper utilities and tools installed.
- [Erik](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/Erik.html) 4/4 points individual - Erik was assigned to develop the page for the Journal along with Sahil, and he successfully integrated it; his work towards it is shown [here](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/commit/0e6a5e15e312003aa29cbca04c2f202f80e65880). Erik also successfully integrated greet into his individual minilab page and provided valuable ideas during our brainwrites; as the technical lead, Erik coordinated these brainwrites. He assisted other members of the team when they needed help, for example with the dropdown. Erik's [video notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iP8-gWius5-_VajB1pgc2nL83-qHCgv0LH-0-uFj4pI/edit?usp=sharing). Erik's personal work/computer plan is to always bring and use his own laptop with all the proper utilities and tools installed.
- [Yash](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/Yash.html) 4/4 points individual - Yash has been working on the [navbar dropdown menu](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/layouts/navbar.html). He has been assisted by all members of the team in making this as it was something that was tough for us, and most of us have evidence of work on the dropdown shown in [commits](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/commits/main); however, Yash laid out the main framework and worked out the kinks, and part of his work for the dropdown is shown [here](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/commit/5a6200b314f22b150ad6f2cac530888f5b5192d1). Here are Yash's [video notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvYaCEGFXtvvHXOfSKYi7fwdPWje5K_kf36yT_YzxKw/edit?usp=sharing). Yash has also successfully integrated greet into his individual minilab page and extensively troubleshot the dropdown. Yash also assisted with testing work from the other developers on the Journal and Minilab pages. Yash's personal work/computer plan is to always bring and use his own laptop with all the proper utilities and tools installed.
- [Isaac](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/Isaac.html) 4/4 points individual - Isaac has worked on making the [about me](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/blob/main/templates/about.html) page. His commits to make fixes and adjustments are shown extensively in the github [commits](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/commits/main) section, and [here](https://github.com/AD1616/flask_portfolio/commit/7bc8001b626c0d76dc7c630535a43649da43591c) is the basic framework that he originally made. Isaac has also thought of [theme pages 1](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1blPXDeaPubER-gAHyGBngrtxeN-vLiY5WKN-2aqO8-Q/edit), [theme page 2](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iUHZpTsHxTqLAXmsw7_yFhUrIjG1LG6v8OYxuNUdkGA/edit), [theme page 3](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-ohIxvq5Q8XuaZxKGwjp4loVQkUf3HMt5p6ulrTQGek/edit?usp=sharing), for our website. Here are Isaac's [video notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-79zrF_rkQSlD2ayyWv9OEqQAF3kZPOUrr91CwQUH5s/edit?usp=sharing). Isaac has successfully integrated greet into his individual minilab page and has played a major role in deciding the design of our website. As a navigator, he has built the highlight of ideation at the top of README(this page) and has also tested work from Developers. Isaac's personal work/computer plan is to always bring and use his own laptop with all the proper utilities and tools installed.


### Project Ideation
- We have planned to stick with [this](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1blPXDeaPubER-gAHyGBngrtxeN-vLiY5WKN-2aqO8-Q/edit) idea for now.


## Project Ideation
### Our Idea: A website that gives the user a personality test and recommends music based on their given personality type
#### Our Audience can learn about their personality type based on their answers on the test.
#### Our website will have information on those who worked on it as well as information about it's production
